        <h1>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">I am Queena T. Jaramilla, 21 years old, born on May 6, 2001 in Binalonan Pangasinan my old hometown, but now I am currently living in Tayug Pangasinan. When I was 5 years old they enrolled in me in Binalonan North Central School for Kindergarten until Grade 6. After graduating Elementary I started schooling in Juan G. Macaraeg High School for Junior and Senior High School. After graduating high school, I started studying at Urdaneta City University as a BS Hospitality Management for First Sem but unfortunately it's not the course that I wanted I was pushed by a Friends. When the second sem enrollment started I shifted as an BS Information Technology student and started studying different programming langauages, it was fun but also a stress thing because of activities.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A few years from now, after I graduate college, I see myself as successful programmer and busy achieving my goals so that I can give my family and my future family a better life.<br><br><br><br><br></p>
